# Engineering guide

A guide to some general engineering good practices. Hopefully a lot of these feel like
common sense, but I've started collecting some of these principles in a central location
so that I can refer colleagues to them and use this as a knowledgebase, as well as keep in
mind some of the arguments for why these practices are good practices.

As I'm primarily a scala developer, some examples and recommendations make most sense in the
context of scala or at least JVM technologies, but I've tried to be as general as possible
and stick to topics which represent sound engineering regardless of stack, and anything
more specifically related to these technologies are in my
[scala guide](https://github.com/giftig/scalaguide/) instead.

## Topics

- [Git](git.md)
